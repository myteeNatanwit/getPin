GetPin component to show childClass and protocol
as in https://medium.com/@mytee/do-the-right-way-with-component-b1cb72247993 <br>and https://medium.com/@mytee/do-the-right-way-with-storyboard-67678b535f85. <br>
The idea of the code is to show calling a component with childClass and protocol to get data back. <br>
Note that: <br>
1-Parent closes the child, the child doesnt close itself with dismiss. <br>
2-extension file to localise the dev and  ... bug.

the original code for the screen is from https://github.com/asklv/Passcode <br>
It is changed with plug in form to be used as component.
